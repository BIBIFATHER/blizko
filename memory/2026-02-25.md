# 2026-02-25

- Founder Mode (Hard Lock) activated with single metric focus: 10 deal_done / 30 days. Requires Risk level before strategy, ask impact on deal_done, stop dispersion, propose minimal tests. Main (Founder/Dispatcher) does not write files; only routes/strategic pressure. Only профильные агенты + blizko-orchestrator write in their zones; orchestrator may write core/memory. Daily update (3–5 lines) + update PROJECT_CONTEXT.md + daily memory is always handled by assistant via orchestrator.
- STABILITY MODE active: workspace = ~/Desktop/blizko 3; no temp workspaces; JSON edits only via CLI/UI. Single source of truth: core/BLIZKO_MASTER_PLAN.md via orchestrator with memory log. Daily rhythm: match/visit/paid/bottleneck log.
- Stage 0 lock: work strictly by PROJECT_MASTER_DOC.md; until 10 paid deals only Weeks 1–2 & listed allowed items; Weeks 5–8, App Store/Capacitor, ML ranking, OCR automation, push, AI B–C, scaling frozen. Stage transition only after 10 paid, 2 repeat requests, confirmed margin.
- Founder Guard Protocol enabled: 3 filters (impact in 14 days, funnel blocker, speeds payment); if any “no” -> Frozen Backlog. WIP limits App ≤2, Ops ≤3. Require Impact/Risk/Measurable outcome before tasks. Orchestrator Delegation Protocol enabled; orchestrator checks Stage/WIP/Founder need, delegates when no strategy/econ/canon/legal change; cannot expand stage or activate frozen blocks.
- joe agent upgraded: can only propose tools via Tool Proposal format; no self-connection; stage-0 relevant only; stage-1+ candidates flagged.
- New agent created by orchestrator: blizko-growth-director with marketing/growth role (profile in AGENT_PROFILES/agents/blizko-growth-director.md). Orchestrator created decision/protocol files for Stage 0 lock, Founder Guard, Orchestrator Delegation, joe tool proposal.
- UI note: OpenClaw Control UI does not auto-sync from files; agents added manually. For joe, no profile file found yet; AGENT_PROFILES/agents contains only blizko-growth-director.md; /agents contains old *.prompt.md.
