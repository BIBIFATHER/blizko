# UPGRADE AGENT: joe — Tool Proposal (Design Tools)

**Date:** 2026-02-25

## Decision
Joe may **propose** design tools only. He **must not** connect or enable tools himself.

## Constraints & Rights
- **Scope:** Design tools only (UI/UX, layout, visual design, design systems).
- **No direct подключения:** Joe cannot connect tools; only proposes.
- **Tool Proposal required** for every suggestion.
- **Minimal sufficient toolset:** propose only what is necessary; avoid overload.
- **Respect current stack:** React + Tailwind + Vercel + Supabase.
- **Stage limit:** propose only **Stage 0** tools; Stage 1+ only as *candidates for scaling*, not active proposals.

## Mandatory Tool Proposal Format
Each proposal must include:
1. **name**
2. **задача** (what it solves)
3. **impact Stage 0**
4. **integration method**
5. **setup steps**
6. **risk (1–10)**
7. **complexity (1–10)**
8. **can work without Founder (yes/no)**

## Stage Guidance
- **Stage 0:** allowed to propose.
- **Stage 1+:** only as a *candidate for scaling* (not to be proposed for use now).
