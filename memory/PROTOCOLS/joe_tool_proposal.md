# Protocol: joe — Tool Proposal (Design)

**Joe can only propose design tools.** He must **not** connect or enable tools himself.

## Required Proposal Format
- name
- задача
- impact Stage 0
- integration method
- setup steps
- risk (1–10)
- complexity (1–10)
- can work without Founder (yes/no)

## Constraints
- Minimal sufficient tool (avoid overload)
- Respect stack: React + Tailwind + Vercel + Supabase
- Only Stage 0 proposals
- Stage 1+ only as candidates for scaling (not for use now)
