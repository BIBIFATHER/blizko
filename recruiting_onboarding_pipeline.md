# Recruiting & Onboarding Pipeline

## 1) Sourcing Steps (End‑to‑End)
**Goal:** build a predictable flow from lead generation → hire → day‑1 readiness.

1. **Define target profile**
   - Role scope, must‑have skills, nice‑to‑haves, compensation range, timezone, start date.
   - Create 2–3 ideal personas (e.g., “Senior Full‑stack, startup‑ready, async‑friendly”).

2. **Source list build**
   - Channels: LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter/X, niche communities, referrals, past candidates, inbound.
   - Create a spreadsheet/ATS list with: name, link, location, role fit, source channel, notes.

3. **Prospect enrichment**
   - Capture: recent projects, relevant stack, evidence of impact, open‑source, writing/speaking.
   - Tag for personalization: product similarity, tech overlap, achievements.

4. **Outbound sequence setup**
   - Use 2‑3 message touchpoints over 7–10 days.
   - Track: send date, reply status, next action, follow‑up due date.

5. **Inbound processing**
   - Auto‑acknowledge with timelines.
   - Apply triage (A/B/C) within 24 hours.

6. **Initial screen**
   - Short async screen or 15–20 min call.
   - Confirm: motivation, comp band, availability, relevant experience.

7. **Evaluation**
   - Work sample / technical / role‑specific interview.
   - Structured rubric; avoid unstructured “vibe” interviews.

8. **Decision & offer**
   - Debrief within 24h.
   - Offer: title, comp, start date, probation, expected outcomes.

9. **Pre‑boarding**
   - Send onboarding checklist, calendar, equipment order, access requests.

10. **Day‑1 onboarding**
    - Welcome plan, buddy assignment, 30/60/90 goals, first tasks.

## 2) A/B/C Triage Checklist
**Goal:** triage all candidates fast, consistently, and fairly.

### A — “Strong fit, prioritize”
- **Role match**: 80%+ of must‑haves
- **Evidence of impact**: clear outcomes, shipped work, measurable results
- **Relevant stack**: direct overlap with current tech/product
- **Seniority alignment**: scope and responsibility fit
- **Communication**: clear, concise, thoughtful
- **Availability/comp**: within range or close

**Action:** respond within 24h, schedule screen within 3–5 days.

### B — “Possible fit, needs validation”
- **Role match**: 60–80% of must‑haves
- **Some evidence of impact** but limited depth
- **Adjacent stack** with transferable skills
- **Unclear seniority fit** or domain gaps
- **Comp/availability** uncertain

**Action:** respond within 48h, send targeted questions, schedule screen if answers strong.

### C — “Not a fit (now)”
- **Role match**: <60% of must‑haves
- **No clear impact** or irrelevant experience
- **Wrong seniority band** (too junior/senior)
- **Comp misalignment**

**Action:** polite decline within 72h; add to long‑term talent pool if promising later.
